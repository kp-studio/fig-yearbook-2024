      "searchText": "5  FOREWORD BY THOMAS BACh T  he Olympic Games Paris 2024 were truly Olympic Games of a new era. The first Olympic Games delivered fully under our Olympic Agenda reforms: younger, more urban, more inclusive, more sustainable. The first ever Olympic Games with full gender parity. A record 84 per cent of the potential global audience followed the Games. This equates to around five billion people and underlines the massive success of the Games in Paris. This record-breaking reach was made possible thanks to our Media RightsHolders, with more coverage made available and watched than ever before, in particular on digital and social media platforms, and the many activations of our Worldwide Olympic Partners. I would personally like to congratulate all of them on their outstanding contributions to the success of these Olympic Games. The IOC is proud and grateful to work together with such a dedicated community of commercial partners. Their commitment ensures the Olympic Games continue to inspire and unite globally. And beyond the Olympic Games, they fuel our mission to make the world a better place through sport. Paris 2024 came at the right time for the expectations of our world, with independent consumer research demonstrating that people believe the Olympic Movement’s mission to unite the world in peaceful competition is more important than ever in a divided world, and that the IOC was successful in this effort. Another landmark achievement is that the Olympic values truly resonate with younger generations, as our research shows. These values were on full display in the Olympic Village, where athletes from  the territories of 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team lived peacefully together under one roof. They created a culture of peace, sending a powerful message across the globe. This message of togetherness, of joie de vivre – this message of peace: this is what people all around the world were longing for. But these Olympic Games could only inspire the world because our French hosts prepared the stage – and what an amazing stage it was. Millions of people celebrating the athletes in the streets of Paris and all across France. Millions of spectators in iconic venues creating an overwhelming atmosphere. More than half of the world’s population sharing in this spectacular showcase of the unity of humankind in all our diversity. The Olympic Games Paris 2024 were a celebration of the athletes and sport at its best. They were a remarkable celebration of the values we hold dear – excellence, solidarity and peace. The Olympic Games are first and foremost about sport. As we have seen in Paris, they are also about much so much more than sport. The partnerships with our Worldwide Olympic Partners and Media RightsHolders, which made all of this possible, are truly a perfect reflection of our Olympic motto: Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together.  Thomas Bach, President, International Olympic Committee"

It was a season of remarkable records and emotions that will forever remain in the hearts of the French people and beyond.

Paris 2024 was a collective project, a vision shared by the entire nation and only made possible by the commitment of our public and private teammates. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to President Bach, the French Government, the City of Paris, the Île-de-France Region, the Métropole du Grand Paris and the Seine-SaintDenis department for their unwavering support and contributions throughout this journey. We are very grateful to the partners, official suppliers and licensees who were all vital to the delivery of the Games. And are very grateful to the broadcasters who were the key to sharing the stories of the competitions.

I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to all the athletes of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. They surpassed every expectation,  showing resilience, determination and the true spirit of Olympism. They are now part of the extraordinary legacy of these Games.

More than half of the world’s population tuned in to experience the magic of these Games. With record-breaking viewership across television, digital platforms and social media, Paris 2024 stands as the most followed Olympic Games in history. This remarkable reach was made possible by the tireless efforts of our Media Rights-Holders and Olympic Broadcasting Services, who provided more comprehensive coverage than ever before. Whether on television, digital platforms or social media, fans had unprecedented access to the excitement and drama of the Games. The engagement across social platforms alone exceeded 12 billion, showcasing the vast global interest and bringing the Olympic spirit to younger and more diverse audiences. Our dedicated efforts to attract non-sport fans, particularly younger generations, through collaborations with influencers and athletes from various fields, further expanded our reach. A key driver of this success was the extraordinary support from our Worldwide Olympic Partners. Their contributions went far beyond traditional sponsorship. From technology and  infrastructure to innovative marketing campaigns, their presence could be felt everywhere – in the streets of Paris, the Olympic Village and across global markets. These partners were instrumental in staging the Games and promoting the Olympic values around the world. This Marketing Report highlights the achievements of our media and commercial partners, whose collaborative efforts not only helped make Paris 2024 a resounding success but also supported the development of sport worldwide. By redistributing 90 per cent of the revenue generated through our marketing programmes, the IOC continues to empower athletes and sports organisations globally.

In a memorable display of the Olympic values, China’s He Bing Jiao consoled an injured Carolina Marín of Spain during the badminton semifinals, exemplifying the respect and camaraderie that the Games inspire.  But Paris 2024 wasn’t just about victories – these were also the first Olympic Games in history with full gender parity, thanks to the distribution of an equal number of quota places to female and male athletes by the IOC. That spirit of inclusion extended throughout the Games, with the Champions Park, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, bringing fans closer to the action with parades for medal-winners, and the Marathon Pour Tous giving thousands of members of the public the chance to take part in marathon and 10km running events along the Olympic route in the heart of Paris.  In a similar vein, the IOC Refugee Olympic Team once again captured hearts, with 37 athletes competing across 12 sports, demonstrating the resilience and determination of individuals displaced by conflict. Their performances reminded the world of the transformative power of sport to provide hope and opportunity, with boxer Cindy Ngamba making history in the women’s 75kg event as she clinched bronze to win the IOC Refugee Olympic Team’s first ever medal.

As the Games drew to a close, IOC President Thomas Bach captured the essence of the event, remarking that the athletes had helped 'to make the City of Light shine brighter than ever before', while it became clear that Paris 2024 had truly fulfilled its vision of “Games Wide Open”, uniting the world through sport and creating a truly inclusive and innovative celebration.  95%  of athletes surveyed rated their overall experience positively"

Working with our Media Rights-Holder partners, more coverage was made available and watched than ever, in particular on digital and social media platforms.” Thomas Bach, IOC President A record 84 per cent of the potential global audience* followed the Olympic Games Paris 2024, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the IOC. This equals around five billion people and means that more than half of the world’s population followed the inspirational achievements of the Olympic athletes and the magic of the Olympic Games, underlining the massive success of the Games in Paris. Media Rights-Holders (MRHs) delivered record results, driven in large part by increased visibility on digital channels. Globally, there were 13 times more social media engagements on MRH handles than for Tokyo 2020. Some 70 per cent of the global audience watched on both television and digital platforms, with MRHs offering more coverage on more platforms than ever before. There was a 25 per cent increase in the amount of coverage watched, with 28.7 billion hours of footage viewed around the world on MRH platforms. This meant every viewer watched on average nine hours of coverage, a 20 per cent increase on the previous Games. In the home market of France, 95 per cent of the potential audience watched an average of 24 hours of coverage of the Olympic Games.  An OBS camera operator captures former world champion skateboarder Gustavo Ribeiro (POR) in action in Paris  Record Coverage and Global Reach As the host broadcaster for the Olympic Games, Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) produced a record 11,000 hours of content for Paris 2024, surpassing any previous Games. This included 3,575 hours of live sports, ceremonies and Champions Park coverage, and represented a 15.8 per cent increase compared to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, enabling MRHs to deliver comprehensive, live coverage around the world across all platforms. As a result, global audiences experienced unprecedented access to the Games, with traditional TV and digital streaming providing deeper and more interactive engagement than ever before.  Athlete-Centric Coverage “I have been watching the Olympic Games on television ever since I was able to, so it is a special feeling to live them here, in Paris.” Lucas Corvee (FRA), badminton  Paris 2024 continued OBS’s tradition of innovation, enhancing the viewer experience through even more immersive storytelling and the use of cutting-edge technology. OBS was committed to delivering innovative coverage that not only  captured the essence of Olympic excellence but also immersed global audiences in the Olympic journey and the personal stories of their favourite athletes. With more athlete-centric and behind-the-scenes coverage, OBS brought the athletes’ stories to the forefront, helping broadcasters deepen viewers' understanding of the sport and foster greater engagement. Technological innovations also played a key role in elevating broadcast coverage to new levels. Cinematic lenses with a shallow depth of field created a more intimate and immersive experience, while a wide array of new data-driven graphics provided real-time, detailed insights into athletes’ performances. Viewers also enjoyed more multi-angle camera replays, offering previously unseen perspectives that fully immersed fans in the action. Additionally, the expanded use of ‘Athlete Moments’ featured emotional, virtual family reunions in post-competition coverage, bringing audiences worldwide closer to the adrenaline, emotion and spirit of the occasion after the athletes walked off the fields of play.  *Potential global audience with access to follow the Olympic Games and over the age of 4 years old"

Automatic Highlights Generation  Intel worked with the IOC, Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) and other members of the ecosystem to spotlight AI’s potential to broaden access to sport through talent identification, power enhanced broadcast viewing capabilities, and enable an accessible and streamlined onsite experience. These technology applications included:  Volumetric Video  Intel AI Platform Experience To take attendees on an immersive journey of becoming an Olympic hopeful, Intel powered the AI Platform Experience at the Stade de France during the Olympic Games. Attended by more than 10,500 fans, the AI-powered fan activation used AI and computer vision to analyse athletic drills and match each participant’s profile to an Olympic sport. Trained on Intel Gaudi accelerators, running on Intel Xeon processors with built-in AI acceleration and optimised with OpenVINO, the experience demonstrated AI’s capability to identify athletic abilities and improve talent detection.  Revolutionary 8K OTT Broadcast Workflow Delivery Paris 2024 was the first edition of the Olympics to utilise Intel Xeon processors to showcase an end-to-end 8K livestreaming experience. Broadcast servers powered by the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel Deep Learning Boost technology encoded and compressed 391 hours of total streaming at 8K/60FPS/HDR, which were distributed by OBS to eight countries worldwide.  To deliver customised content to fans, OBS Automatic Highlights Generation, trained on the Intel Geti platform, used AI to package tailored highlights across more than 30 sporting events for the first time. This effort resulted in the production of more than 100,000 personalised videos during the Games.  Two volumetric video studios set up at the International Broadcast Centre and the Olympic and Paralympic Village helped bring fans immersive 3D videos of their favourite athletes. Powered by Intel Xeon processors and optimised with Intel OpenVINO, the studios rendered more than 3,000 augmented reality clips for sharing across all platforms, demonstrating new immersive ways for fans to engage with athletes.  Universal Accessibility Wayfinding Solution Intel’s AI platform technology enabled greater accessibility at the Team USA training site in Paris and the International Paralympic Committee headquarters in Bonn, Germany.

Continuing its legacy of precise measurement, the Swiss brand brought more than 90 years of experience to its timekeeping role and arrived in Paris with the most advanced technology it has ever delivered. A total of 550 OMEGA Timekeepers were deployed across the venues, who relied on 350 tonnes of equipment.  New Photofinish Camera One of OMEGA’s new timekeeping innovations at Paris 2024 was the Scan‘O’Vision ULTIMATE photofinish camera. Now enhanced with the highest resolution of any photofinish camera on the market, the technology captured up to 40,000 digital images per second on the finish line of races to provide each official result. The men’s 100m final in Paris was the closest in history and the ULTIMATE played a critical role in helping to decide that historic moment.  Timekeeping Highlights In total, 132 Olympic records were measured by OMEGA during Paris 2024, as well as 38 world records. Some of the most notable were the four Olympic records in swimming set by Léon Marchand of France, as well as the new world record in the men’s pole vault, reached by Mondo Duplantis of Sweden.  65  OMEGA House OMEGA House was the Swiss brand’s exclusive home for the duration of the Olympic Games Paris 2024.

The OMEGA Pavilion Located in the middle of the Parc de Bercy, the OMEGA Pavilion was an interactive venue that showcased OMEGA’s role as Official Timekeeper. Through a series of revealing installations, visitors were able to get hands-on with a variety of sports, and truly understand the timing behind each one. The main highlight was the Race of Champions experience, where visitors could test their sprinting skills on a 10m running track and digitally compete against real Olympic or Paralympic athletes.

Accessible People Mover The Accessible People Mover (APM) is Toyota's electric mobility vehicle designed specifically for Paris 2024 to transport people, goods, and act as a stretcher in emergencies. The APM features integrated wheelchair ramps, comfortable seats, and a top speed of 20 km/h. Its low floor and wide doors ensure easy and safe boarding. Additionally, the APM is eco-friendly, running on battery power and producing zero tailpipe emissions. Designed by Toyota Motor Europe in Belgium and manufactured in Toyota Caetano Portugal, the 250 APM covered 140,000 kilometres during Paris 2024, enhancing the mobility experience for athletes, staff, volunteers, and visitors.  Last-mile mobility solutions Toyota co-developed Yosh-e – the wheelchair e-puller – to bring their vision of “Mobility for all” to life at the Paralympic Games Paris 2024. The Yosh-e converts a classic mechanical wheelchair into a battery-powered electric mobility solution, giving more freedom of movement to wheelchair users. During the Paralympic Games, the Toyota team installed over 240 brackets on athletes’ wheelchairs so that they could make use of the 50 Yosh-e e-pullers, made available through the KINTO app. In addition to the Yosh-e wheelchair puller, Toyota also provided electric last-mile  73  mobility solutions such as C+WalkS and C+WalkT to the volunteers and the athletes of Paris 2024, allowing the latter to save their energy for their performances.  100 per cent electrified vehicle fleet In line with Toyota’s multi-path strategy and commitment to support Paris 2024’s environmental ambitions, the company delivered a 100 per cent electrified passenger vehicle fleet. In fact, approximately 60 per cent of the fleet were zero-tailpipe emissions, including battery electric vehicles (BEV) like the Toyota bZ4X, Proace, Proace Verso and Lexus RZ, as well as fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) like the Toyota Mirai. Additionally, Toyota brought around 1,000 hybrid (HEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicles, including the globally best-selling RAV4 in both PHEV and HEV versions, along with the Toyota Corolla TS, Yaris Cross and Highlander, all featuring hybrid technology. Around 60 per cent of the Toyota fleet was produced in Europe, including 37 per cent in France, contributing to the vision of a sustainable and locally sourced Paris 2024.  100%  electrified passenger fleet  2,700+  electrified vehicles  Hydrogen society Toyota demonstrated its vision of a hydrogen society through more than ten applications, ranging from passenger cars to heavy-duty transport, highlighting the potential of hydrogen technology in achieving carbon neutrality. The diverse fleet included 500 Mirai, 14 Caetano fuel cell buses, 10 fuel cell coaches, two fuel cell Hilux, and others – in total over 10 different applications. Hydrogen-powered, zero tailpipe emission vehicles at Paris 2024 achieved an impressive milestone,  850+  inclusive mobility solutions  covering over one million kilometres – equivalent to 25 trips around the globe, and using nearly 12 tons of hydrogen sourced from renewable origins."

Team Visa for Paris 2024 featured 147 athletes representing 67 countries across 40 sports, making this Visa’s largest and most diverse roster yet - featuring 67 men and 80 women, and increasing the representation of Paralympic athletes at Paris 2024.

Blending sports with culture and commerce To give thanks to Parisians for opening their city and country to the world and providing a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere for all, Visa celebrated the intersection of sport, art, and culture by commissioning six global artists to create works of art to appear on billboards throughout Paris (a global capital for street art). The street art installations highlighted Visa Go, a mobile app designed to help users experience the best of the city. The app enabled access  75  to Team Visa content, and a curated selection of discounts and offers from official partners, local shops, and restaurants. Visa’s aim was to celebrate the Olympic and Paralympic Games and help promote local small businesses and culture through art. The street art included works from leading street artist Marko 93 (France) from Seine-Saint-Denis; influential street artist and activist Swoon (USA); pioneering graffiti artist JonOne (USA); native Parisian artist Olivia De Bona (France); prolific colourblind street artist Alex Senna (Brazil); and multidisciplinary artist Vexta (Australia) and received significant media interest.  147  Team Visa for Paris 2024 featured 147 athletes  Helping to boost the French economy Additionally, the French economy benefited from hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and Visa played a part in this success, according to proprietary data which revealed Visa cardholder spending patterns during the Olympic Games.
