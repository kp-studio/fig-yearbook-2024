The first Olympic Games delivered fully under our Olympic Agenda reforms: younger, more urban, more inclusive, more sustainable. The first ever Olympic Games with full gender parity. A record 84 per cent of the potential global audience followed the Games. This equates to around five billion people and underlines the massive success of the Games in Paris. This record-breaking reach was made possible thanks to our Media RightsHolders, with more coverage made available and watched than ever before, in particular on digital and social media platforms, and the many activations of our Worldwide Olympic Partners. I would personally like to congratulate all of them on their outstanding contributions to the success of these Olympic Games. The IOC is proud and grateful to work together with such a dedicated community of commercial partners. Their commitment ensures the Olympic Games continue to inspire and unite globally. And beyond the Olympic Games, they fuel our mission to make the world a better place through sport. Paris 2024 came at the right time for the expectations of our world, with independent consumer research demonstrating that people believe the Olympic Movement’s mission to unite the world in peaceful competition is more important than ever in a divided world, and that the IOC was successful in this effort. Another landmark achievement is that the Olympic values truly resonate with younger generations, as our research shows. These values were on full display in the Olympic Village, where athletes from  the territories of 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team lived peacefully together under one roof. They created a culture of peace, sending a powerful message across the globe. This message of togetherness, of joie de vivre – this message of peace: this is what people all around the world were longing for. But these Olympic Games could only inspire the world because our French hosts prepared the stage – and what an amazing stage it was. Millions of people celebrating the athletes in the streets of Paris and all across France. Millions of spectators in iconic venues creating an overwhelming atmosphere. More than half of the world’s population sharing in this spectacular showcase of the unity of humankind in all our diversity. The Olympic Games Paris 2024 were a celebration of the athletes and sport at its best. They were a remarkable celebration of the values we hold dear – excellence, solidarity and peace. The Olympic Games are first and foremost about sport. As we have seen in Paris, they are also about much so much more than sport. The partnerships with our Worldwide Olympic Partners and Media RightsHolders, which made all of this possible, are truly a perfect reflection of our Olympic motto: Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together.  Thomas Bach, President, International Olympic Committee"

In a similar vein, the IOC Refugee Olympic Team once again captured hearts, with 37 athletes competing across 12 sports, demonstrating the resilience and determination of individuals displaced by conflict.

Working with our Media Rights-Holder partners, more coverage was made available and watched than ever, in particular on digital and social media platforms.” Thomas Bach, IOC President A record 84 per cent of the potential global audience* followed the Olympic Games Paris 2024, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the IOC. This equals around five billion people and means that more than half of the world’s population followed the inspirational achievements of the Olympic athletes and the magic of the Olympic Games, underlining the massive success of the Games in Paris. Media Rights-Holders (MRHs) delivered record results, driven in large part by increased visibility on digital channels. Globally, there were 13 times more social media engagements on MRH handles than for Tokyo 2020. Some 70 per cent of the global audience watched on both television and digital platforms, with MRHs offering more coverage on more platforms than ever before. There was a 25 per cent increase in the amount of coverage watched, with 28.7 billion hours of footage viewed around the world on MRH platforms. This meant every viewer watched on average nine hours of coverage, a 20 per cent increase on the previous Games. In the home market of France, 95 per cent of the potential audience watched an average of 24 hours of coverage of the Olympic Games.  An OBS camera operator captures former world champion skateboarder Gustavo Ribeiro (POR) in action in Paris  Record Coverage and Global Reach As the host broadcaster for the Olympic Games, Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) produced a record 11,000 hours of content for Paris 2024, surpassing any previous Games. This included 3,575 hours of live sports, ceremonies and Champions Park coverage, and represented a 15.8 per cent increase compared to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, enabling MRHs to deliver comprehensive, live coverage around the world across all platforms. As a result, global audiences experienced unprecedented access to the Games, with traditional TV and digital streaming providing deeper and more interactive engagement than ever before.

OBS was committed to delivering innovative coverage that not only  captured the essence of Olympic excellence but also immersed global audiences in the Olympic journey and the personal stories of their favourite athletes. With more athlete-centric and behind-the-scenes coverage, OBS brought the athletes’ stories to the forefront, helping broadcasters deepen viewers' understanding of the sport and foster greater engagement. Technological innovations also played a key role in elevating broadcast coverage to new levels. Cinematic lenses with a shallow depth of field created a more intimate and immersive experience, while a wide array of new data-driven graphics provided real-time, detailed insights into athletes’ performances. Viewers also enjoyed more multi-angle camera replays, offering previously unseen perspectives that fully immersed fans in the action. Additionally, the expanded use of ‘Athlete Moments’ featured emotional, virtual family reunions in post-competition coverage, bringing audiences worldwide closer to the adrenaline, emotion and spirit of the occasion after the athletes walked off the fields of play.  *Potential global audience with access to follow the Olympic Games and over the age of 4 years old"

This effort resulted in the production of more than 100,000 personalised videos during the Games.  Two volumetric video studios set up at the International Broadcast Centre and the Olympic and Paralympic Village helped bring fans immersive 3D videos of their favourite athletes.

AT PARIS 2024, IT BLENDED THE TIMELESS SYMBOLISM OF THE OLYMPIC RINGS WITH THE ELEGANCE AND CREATIVITY OF FRANCE The Olympic rings are one of the most recognised symbols in the world, and during the Olympic Games Paris 2024, their enduring appeal was on full display. Towering over the French capital, a giant set of Olympic rings was installed on the iconic Eiffel Tower, measuring 29 meters wide and 13 meters high, and weighing 30 tonnes. Suspended between the first and second floors – approximately 60 metres above the ground – these huge rings became one of Paris’s most photographed sights, standing as a stunning testament to the unifying power of the Games, drawing locals and visitors alike to capture the moment and celebrate the Olympic spirit. For athletes, the Olympic rings were just as iconic and personal. No stay in Paris was complete without posing for a selfie in front of the Olympic Village’s own set of rings – a symbol of their participation in the Games and the realisation of their Olympic dreams. These images, shared widely on social media, reinforced the rings’ timeless appeal and their role in creating unforgettable memories for athletes and fans alike.  Very few symbols can inspire such universal recognition and emotional connection. Yet the Olympic rings transcend sport, embodying the values of excellence, friendship and respect. First designed by Pierre de Coubertin over a century ago, they represent the unity of the five continents in peaceful competition. Independent research commissioned by the IOC confirms their extraordinary reach, with nine out of ten people worldwide able to identify the rings. Beyond their symbolic significance, the Olympic rings are integral to the commercial success of the Olympic Movement. Their universal recognition attracts global partners eager to align with the positive values and extensive reach of the Games, enabling the IOC to continue inspiring the world through sport.  “W hen you enter the track and you see those five rings, that's goosebumps.”  Independent surveys conducted on behalf of the IOC have revealed that people believe that the Olympic Movement’s mission to unite the world in peaceful competition is more important than ever, and that the Olympic values truly resonate with younger generations. In consumer insight studies, 78 per cent of those surveyed said they believed the Olympic Games are more important than ever in a divided world, while three out of four also believed that the IOC was successful in “bringing the world together in peaceful competition” and in “building a better world through sport”. According to an independent brand tracker study conducted in September 2024, the relevance of the Olympic Games for Gen Z is now higher than for the general population, including outperforming other demographic groups in the metrics of “engagement with the Olympics”, “brand affinity” and “brand relevance”. This was driven in particular by the “inspiring stories of the athletes”, the “buzz on social media” and “improved accessibility to content”.  	 Julie Nicolaes (BEL, cycling)  The Olympic Symbol Designed by Baron Pierre de Coubertin in 1913  The relevance of the Olympic Games and the Olympic brand  First shown on an Olympic flag in 1914  Visual representation of Olympism Interlinked rings show how athletes come together at the Games Rings represent the five continents of the world Can be identified by 9 out of 10 people globally"

Its symmetrical design reflected balance and harmony, while ripples along its surface evoked the River Seine.  • Pictograms Paris 2024 reimagined the Olympic pictograms, elevating them into striking coats of arms representing each sport.

This unique partnership ensures that the Olympic Games can be delivered to the highest standard while promoting sport worldwide. Unauthorised use of the Olympic rings and other Olympic properties1 – known as ambush marketing2 – threatens the integrity of the Olympic brand. Such actions diminish the value of official partnerships, jeopardising the revenue generated to support  athletes and sports organisations globally. Protecting the commercial value of the Olympic brand is therefore essential to safeguarding the future of the Olympic Movement. The IOC works closely with National Olympic Committees (NOCs), Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs), and local governments to educate businesses and stakeholders about the importance of official partnerships and the harm caused by ambush marketing. Each infringement is reviewed individually, with the IOC and its partners taking appropriate action to maintain the integrity of the brand and the investment of its partners.  1 Olympic properties (as defined by the Olympic Charter) include without limitation the Olympic symbol, flag, motto, anthem, identifications (including but not limited to “Olympic Games” and “Games of the Olympiad”), designations, emblems, mascots, flame, torches, images and/or terminology, and any and all rights derived from the Olympic Games and/or the Youth Olympic Games. 2 Direct and/or indirect unauthorised association with, exploitation or promotion of, the Olympic properties and/or the Games."

These properties, including emblems, logos, and designations, were safeguarded under French national law, ensuring that their use was strictly controlled and authorised only by the Paris 2024 Organising Committee. The IOC and Paris 2024 implemented a global Brand Protection Programme to uphold the integrity of these intellectual properties and preserve the value of the Olympic brand. This comprehensive programme included: • Monitoring the Internet: Dedicated teams used advanced technologies to identify and address unauthorised use of Olympic properties online, including illegal streaming and unlicensed merchandise.  111  The programme aimed to detect and act against any infringement, ensuring the exclusivity of the Olympic brand. • Collaborating with Law Enforcement: The Paris 2024 Organising Committee worked closely with law enforcement agencies to combat counterfeit goods. These efforts protected the official merchandise and ensured that consumers received authentic products while supporting the Games’ licensed suppliers. • Maintaining Compliance: By overseeing the use of intellectual properties, the programme upheld the commitments made to the IOC by Paris 2024 and safeguarded the investments of official partners. The Paris 2024 Brand Protection Programme played a vital role in defending the commercial and symbolic value of the Olympic Games. Its success ensured that the revenue generated by official partnerships could continue to support the athletes, sports organisations, and the Olympic Movement as a whole.  Global Broadcast and Internet Monitoring The global broadcast of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 relied on the exclusive rights granted to Media Rights-Holders (MRHs). Protecting these rights was a priority for the IOC, as illegal streaming and unauthorised use of audiovisual content poses significant threats to the value of the partnerships. The IOC’s Internet Monitoring Programme (IMP) used cutting-edge technology to prevent and track online violations, particularly live streaming infringements. The programme targeted illegal content across websites, social media platforms, and mobile applications, taking swift action to ensure that viewers accessed the Games through official channels. In addition to enforcement, the IOC and MRHs conducted promotional campaigns to inform audiences worldwide where, when, and how to watch official coverage of the Games. These efforts not only enhanced viewership but also acted as a powerful deterrent against piracy."
