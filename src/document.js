      "searchText": "Introduction  President's foreword  PRESIDENT’S FOREWORD Morinari Watanabe FIG President IOC member  I  believe that the best word to qualify 2024 would be “emotion”. Of course, one of the highlights of the year was the Olympic Games Paris 2024, which brought the world together for two thrilling weeks of sport, friendship and solidarity. In addition to the annual World Cup and World Challenge Cup series, we also had three world championships – the 29th FIG Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships in Guimarães (POR), the 18th FIG Aerobic Gymnastics World Championships in Pesaro (ITA), and the 2nd FIG Parkour World Championships in Kitakyushu (JPN). During these events, we supported our athletes with all our hearts, and they showed us their best performances. They also reminded us of the unique power of sport: uniting people. It is in this spirit that I established the FIG Gymnastics and Peace Working Group. Additionally, I am happy to report that our social media community grew significantly in 2024, thanks to the enthusiasm of our fans. This growth can be explained by several factors, which are presented in this yearbook.  04  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  2024 was an important year on the institutional side as well, with the FIG Council in Shanghai (CHN) and the 85th FIG Congress taking place in Doha (QAT), which attracted a record number of delegates. The Congress brought the 2021-2024 cycle to a close, as the authorities for the new cycle (20252028) were elected. You can find further information about this in the institutional section of the yearbook. Our work towards the development of gymnastics around the world continued, with educational activities taking place on all five continents. It is also worth mentioning the Executive Committee meeting in Kampala (UGA); these yearly meetings hosted by developing national federations have proven to be a unique opportunity to boost the development of gymnastics in the host country, as they generate a lot of interest in the local media and provide the FIG authorities with a better overview of the situation. I am sure that we can build on the success of 2024 to pursue our expansion in the years to come, always committed to the true essence of sport: solidarity."

This coming together of the global GfA community between 20 and 22 March featured representatives of 35 nations, who gathered in the coastal city of Aracaju (BRA), headquarters of the Brazilian Gymnastics Confederation (CBG). The three-day programme began with delegates reflecting on lessons learned from the World Gymnaestrada Amsterdam 2023 and looking ahead to the World Gym for Life Challenge 2025. For a group drawn from five continents, there was also the chance to discuss the GfA Manual. “The first day we looked at what we are – what is Gymnastics for All?” explained Valerio. “We asked about our definition and rules and considered the manual and how we can update it as a tool for development as we look to the future.”  Research-driven support Another significant discussion point of the Colloquium concerned the wish for more research. “We looked at the link with universities and building scientific evidence for Gymnastics for All,” said Valerio. There were examples given from countries – Brazil, Japan and Switzerland – where GfA is already part of the university curriculum and where research has begun into the benefits of lifelong gymnastics. Safeguarding provided the focus for another discussion while the final morning of presentations allowed delegates to reflect on the work of the different continental unions and their future goals – starting with the Brazilian hosts. According to Valerio, this underlined the importance of the Colloquium as a platform for sharing ideas and building connections. “You can develop solutions knowing there are other countries with the same issues, based on those examples. It’s about showing people that they’re not alone in developing gymnastics.”  35  countries represented at the Colloquium  “We highlighted the importance of the development of GfA via universities – the importance of it being part of the curriculum, and producing research and scientific support for our work.” Rogerio Valerio President of the FIG GfA Committee  Pictured Attendees of the Gymnastics for All Colloquium 2024  14  FIG YEARBOOK 2024"

Two days later, the 27-year-old overcame a slip-up on Uneven Bars with a solid routine on Balance Beam – an apparatus that tests gymnasts the most mentally – and with it underlined that she had vanquished the demons of Tokyo three years earlier, which led to her taking a break from the sport to care for her mental health. Moreover, it ensured her a lead of just 0.166 going into the final rotation, and her brilliant display on Floor made sure of victory. By finishing clear of Rebeca Andrade (BRA) and Tokyo 2020 champion Sunisa Lee (USA) in that All-Around final, Biles became the third person after Larisa Latynina (URS) and Vera Caslavska (TCH) to have captured two Olympic All-Around titles in Women’s Artistic Gymnastics. And, by the end of the Games, she had increased her medal tally to four. She claimed her third gold on Vault – with a Yurchenko double pike, which earned a score of 15.700 – and finished with the silver medal on Floor Exercise.  Andrade becomes Brazil’s top Olympian This takes us to the other truly outstanding female gymnast in Paris, the aforementioned Andrade, Biles’s biggest rival in recent years, whose four medals included the gold on Floor. The 25-year-old began with an historic team bronze after Brazil pipped Great Britain to the podium by just 0.034 and  18  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  she then earned a second consecutive silver in the All-Around and another on Vault before concluding with that triumph on Floor Exercise on 5 August. With her score of 14.166, she had the thinnest of winning margins over Biles (14.133) and the American responded in sporting fashion, bowing to Andrade as she stepped on to the podium. Finally, with her feats in France, Andrade became the most successful Brazilian athlete in Olympic history, with six medals now overall.  2 Olympic newcomer nations: Indonesia and Haiti  Italy and Algeria blaze new trails There was plenty of other history made, starting in the team final. While the USA group could celebrate a fourth title for their nation - after victories in 1996, 2012 and 2016 - Italy's matched their country's best-ever result with the silver medal, accomplished at the Olympic Games Amsterdam 1928. Meanwhile, Brazil mounted the podium for the first time, taking bronze. There were further Italian celebrations when Alice D’Amato then won her country’s first Olympic gold in gymnastics on Balance Beam after a tense final in which four of the competitors came off the apparatus. Another history-maker was Kaylia Nemour (ALG), 17, whose gold on Uneven Bars was not only a first Olympic medal in gymnastics for Algeria but for any African nation. Nemour, who previously represented France, prevailed ahead of the 2023 world champion Qiu Qiyuan (CHN).  Above Rebeca Andrade (BRA) Below Alice D’Amato (ITA)"

F  or the men of Team Japan — Tokyo 2020 Olympic All-Around champion Hashimoto Daiki, emerging star Oka Shinnosuke, Kaya Kazuma, Sugino Takaaki and Tanigawa Wataru — the Olympic Games Paris 2024 began in perfect fashion on 29 July as they beat the People’s Republic of China to the gold medal, after their rivals’ uncharacteristic collapse on Horizontal Bar. In a dramatic final rotation, Xiao Ruoteng landed on his knees and Su Weide fell twice. Hashimoto duly took advantage with a spectacular routine that secured gold for his team – and some personal redemption after his failure to qualify for the final of Horizontal Bar, an event in which he had won gold in Tokyo. Japan finished with a score of 259.594 to the 259.062 of a China team comprising Xiao, Su, Liu Yang, Zhang Boheng and Zou Jingyuan. The USA quintet of Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Stephen Nedoroscik and Fred Richard collected bronze to secure their nation’s first men’s team medal since 2008. Two days later, the projected battle between Hashimoto and Zhang for All-Around supremacy never materialised. Instead, 20-year-old Oka emerged as the discipline’s new star in Paris, taking gold ahead of Zhang and Xiao, and then adding the Horizontal Bar to walk off with the same golds that Hashimoto had won in Tokyo three years earlier. With two titles and nine medals overall, meanwhile, China confirmed their superiority in the domain of the specialists. Zou and Liu produced successful title defences on Parallel Bars and Still Rings, while All-Around silver medallist Zhang added a bronze on Horizontal Bar.  20  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  Yulo feats display depth of competition In total, 16 different countries won medals in Artistic Gymnastics – men’s and women’s combined – at the Olympic Games Paris 2024. The sight of gymnasts from far and wide delivering elite-level performances highlighted how rising standards across the globe mean more intense competition on the biggest stage. The Men’s Artistic Gymnastics competition provided more than one outstanding example of this, starting with Carlos Yulo (PHI). A world champion on both Floor Exercise and Vault during the past five years, Yulo became the first man from the Philippines to win an Olympic title in any sport when he emerged victorious in the Floor final on 3 August. There were tears of celebration after the 24-year-old forced defending champion Artem Dolgopyat (ISR) into second place – having scored 15.000 points, the highest on Floor Exercise at the Games.  “If you want a public connection with the sport, we have to create stories and connect with the public. It was a great success for the spectators.” Arturs Mickevics President of the Men’s Artistic Gymnastics Technical Committee  Pictured Oka Shinnosuke (JPN) Below Carlos Yulo (PHI)"

Another nation breaking new ground was Ireland, which had never before won an Olympic medal in gymnastics yet now saw Rhys McClenaghan capture gold on Pommel Horse.

Barajas, still just 17 when he won his medal, had actually qualified on Parallel Bars yet it was on the Horizontal Bar that he became the youngest Colombian medallist in Olympic history. His performance had the highest difficulty score of all the finalists, but he lost out on gold to Oka only on the tie-break rule, with the superior execution score winning.

As well as the first gold medal for her country in the discipline, it was also only the second overall following the bronze won by Regina Weber in 1984 when representing West Germany. For Varfolomeev, then still 17, her gold capped a meteoric rise. In 2022, her debut year as a senior, she won the All-Around silver medal at the World Championships. In 2023, she swept the board at the worlds in Valencia (ESP), winning all five medals on offer. And now this triumph at the Porte de la Chapelle Arena where she achieved the highest score on every apparatus except Ribbon. With a final tally of 142.850, she finished 2.250 points clear of the silver medallist, Boryana Kaleyn (BUL). For Kaleyn, meanwhile, the only other gymnast to break the 140.000 total barrier, this was an historic achievement too as she rose from fifth place at Tokyo 2020 to secure the first individual Rhythmic Gymnastics Olympic medal of any colour for Bulgaria since 1988.

For China, this was their first Olympic gold medal in Rhythmic, and only their second-ever medal in the discipline following a silver in Beijing 2008. Their routines – particularly with the 3 Ribbons + 2 Balls – stood out not only for their technique and difficulty but also for the showcasing of Chinese music and dance styles.

Page’s triumph provided the most compelling story of the Trampoline competition at the Bercy Arena. Her victory felt even more momentous given the context of not only the Olympic chapters that had come before but also the ankle problem that flared up after she won her second world championship title in front of her home spectators in Birmingham (GBR) eight months earlier.

Tin Srbic and Artur Davtyan are two of the 25 gymnasts who benefitted from the programme in the lead up to Paris 2024. For Srbic, who won silver on Horizontal Bar at Tokyo 2020 and qualified for the final in Paris, Olympic Solidarity gives him the opportunity to focus on sport. “It allows you to think less about stuff that regular people have to think about: the costs of living, for food, of rehabilitation and recovery,”  28  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  Srbic says. “It helps us a lot to take our minds off those things and be secure so that we can focus on our Olympic journey.” Past recipients of the scholarship include some of the sport’s most illustrious names: Olympic gold medallists Eleftherios Petrounias (GRE), Nina Derwael (BEL), Artem Dolgopyat (ISR) and Linoy Ashram (ISR), among others.

World Cups occupy the early part of the international season, while a similar World Challenge Cup series concludes during the second half of the year. In 2024, the World Cup events also served as Olympic qualification events for eligible gymnasts, adding an extra layer of excitement to each event. The 2024 FIG Apparatus World Cup series spanned four events between February and April, with competitions in Cairo (EGY), Cottbus (GER), Baku (AZE) and Doha (QAT). The World Challenge Cup series began in Antalya (TUR) in March, then turned to Osijek (CRO), Varna (BUL) and Koper (SLO) before concluding in Szombathely (HUN) in October.  Standout moments Women  Charlize Moerz (AUT) recorded the first-ever victory by an Austrian female gymnast when she took the Floor Exercise title in Baku, and Kaylia Nemour (ALG) went undefeated on Uneven Bars in the Apparatus World Cup series before winning the Olympic title in Paris. Melanie de Jesus dos Santos (FRA) was the only double-winner of the World Challenge Cup series, prevailing on both Uneven Bars and Floor Exercise.  Men Illia Kovtun (UKR) followed up his World Cup series victory on Parallel Bars with Olympic silver on the same apparatus before he then won the World Challenge Cup title on Floor Exercise. Another Apparatus World Cup/World Challenge Cup double-winner was Tang Chia-Hung (TPE), who sandwiched Horizontal Bar feats with an Olympic bronze on the same apparatus.

As the season heated up, World Challenge Cups in Portimão (POR) and Cluj-Napoca (ROU) served as an Olympic warmup for gymnasts and groups.  Standout moments  WORLD CUPS AND WORLD CHALLENGE CUPS  In what turned out to be a foretaste of the Olympic finals, world All-Around champions Darja Varfolomeev (GER) and Sofia Raffaeli (ITA) jostled for position throughout the World Cup series, while the People’s Republic of China, Italy and France split the group series titles.  Each year the FIG World Cup and World Challenge Cup series attract top contenders and specialists in gymnastics’ Olympic disciplines. The 2024 editions were notable for several historic firsts underlining gymnastics’ global growth. For non-Olympic disciplines, please refer to the Acrobatic, Aerobic and Parkour chapters.  Trampoline Gymnastics  Men  Competitions in Baku (AZE) and Cottbus (GER) capped a World Cup odyssey that stretched over two calendar years for Olympic Trampoline hopefuls. Events in Alkmaar (NED), Arosa (SUI) and Coimbra (POR) completed the 2024 series, with the next generation of Trampoline greats already omnipresent.  Non-Olympic Trampoline disciplines  Standout moments Women  Her excellent performances in Baku, Arosa and Coimbra secured Anzhela Bladtceva (AIN) the women’s individual series title. Seljan Mahsudova (AZE) scored a rare perfect 10 for Horizontal Displacement at the World Cup in Alkmaar, staying inside the central square of the trampoline for her entire routine (no easy feat!) as she earned her first World Cup title.  Tokyo 2020 champion Ivan Litvinovich (AIN) took the men’s individual Trampoline series title before adding his second Olympic gold in Paris.  Other World Cup luminaries in 2024 were Cao Yunzhu (CHN) and Zhang Xinxin (CHN), who won the women’s Synchronised series title having gathered golds in Cottbus (GER), Arosa, and Coimbra, and the victorious men’s Synchronised pair of Samuele Patisso Colonna and Marco Lavino (ITA). Two of the World Cup staging posts featured Tumbling too – Baku and Coimbra – and world champion Mikhail Malkin (AZE) took gold both times in the men’s category while Alexandra Efraimoglou (GRE) won the women’s category after prevailing in Portugal. Aliah Raga (USA) and Francisco Jose (POR) were declared series winners in Double Mini-Trampoline, with the event contested only in Coimbra.  FIG YEARBOOK 2024 31"

Women’s Additions Five original elements performed in major competition for the first time in Women’s Artistic Gymnastics in 2024 have been added to the ever-evolving Code of Points, with four of them named after their creators. Those named include a 1.5-twisting double tuck somersault on Floor Exercise by Hillary Heron (PAN), as well as unique takes on the classics, such as the marriage of the Weiler to the Comaneci salto by Thelma Adalsteinsdottir (ISL) on Uneven Bars. Kate Sayer (AUS) inked her name into the code by revisiting an in-bar Stalder and melding it with a transition on Uneven Bars, while Marija Petrova (LAT) proposed an elegant and deceptively complicated mount on the same apparatus. Reese Esponda (USA) dreamed up the backward butterfly jump on Floor Exercise and first performed her variation at the 2024 FIG Apparatus  World Cup in Baku (AZE). While it has been added to the Code of Points, it was given a B valuation (0.2 difficulty) and new elements must be valued at C or higher for them to be named.  Men’s additions Joseph Solis (MEX) entered the Code of Points for Men’s Artistic Gymnastics on Parallel Bars with a giant swing backwards and salto with a half-twist to hang. On the same apparatus, Joaquin Alvarez (CHI) devised a new dismount: a double layout done off the end of the bars. John Roethlisberger (USA) had two elements retrospectively incorporated for his work on Horizontal Bar: the first is a tucked double salto forward with 1.5 twists over the bar that he performed successfully at the 1995 World Championships, the second a laid out double salto forward with half-twist that he showed at the 1996 Olympic Games.

A  ccording to the annual SportonSocial report, published by RedTorch, the FIG experienced the biggest increase in engagement among all international sports federations between Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. The FIG saw 5.2 times more engagement across Facebook, Instagram and X, which was well above the average of 2.4 times across all international federations. Instagram proved to be the most successful social network by far for the FIG in 2024 as the federation ranked joint second with World Aquatics in the SportonSocial league table, an increase of eight places from 2023.  44  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  Highlighting one specific example of Paris 2024’s impact, a clip of bronze medallist Sofia Raffaeli (ITA) performing in the Rhythmic Gymnastics at the Games on 7 August was played almost 72m times. The FIG also maintained a strong presence on Facebook and X, placing third and sixth respectively in the SportonSocial league table. New initiatives such as a dedicated effort to collect behind-the-scenes content and an automated integration between a new digital asset management platform and athletes’ social media accounts will help to build on this success on the road to the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028."

A  s the FIG prepares to launch its new commercial strategy for the 2025-2028 cycle, a deep dive into the sponsorship landscape has provided invaluable insights that will shape the way forward. In 2024, the FIG commissioned a market research study with The Sports Consultancy. The main objective of this project was to better understand the shifts in brand expectations and to obtain a reliable valuation and positioning of commercial rights within sports marketing. “It’s not just about visibility anymore. It’s about creating genuine value and building trust with audiences,” as one partner pointed out. These insights are at the heart of the FIG’s evolving commercial model.  The federation is undertaking a strategic shift aimed at long-term, sustainable growth – moving from a transactional approach to one that is built on stronger, more tailored relationships with partners. Backed by data and aligned with current market trends, the new strategy will introduce: • A more structured rights offering to address multiple brand objectives. • Stronger valuation models to increase sponsor confidence and to unlock new investment potential. This is more than a new commercial chapter; it is a commitment to listen, adapt, and grow together with our partners.  The study revealed several critical priorities for sponsors:  90%  prioritise a strong sense of purpose and alignment with a rights holder’s values.  60%  believe that bespoke content creation is more important than ever.  46  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  90%  expect clear data on the demographic and psychographic profile of fans.  68%  see social media as the main platform for sponsorship activation.  It is a commitment to listen, adapt and grow together with our partners."

A  s Fujitsu’s Judging Support System plays an ever more important role in Artistic Gymnastics, the technology behind it is constantly evaluated and finetuned. This was again the case in 2024 with improvements made to the system’s skeletal recognition accuracy. This means that the functionality of the JSS was enhanced to exclude non-athlete subjects within the camera footage – such as spectators, coaches and judges – from the recognition target. The acceptable range of lens zoom ratios was also expanded and the  software-based scaling of captured video was introduced. This ensured greater flexibility in camera placement compared with previous versions. The JSS is used in the event of blocked scores or inquiries at the Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, providing real-time movement capture to support the analysis of the elements. The refinements carried out in 2024 are all the more valuable given that, since May 2023, the system has been officially employed on every Artistic Gymnastics apparatus.  FIG ADDS MIKELART TO PARTNERS A short-term partnership was agreed with the Italian jewellery brand.  T  he FIG signed a partnership agreement with Mikelart in May 2024, ensuring that the Italian jewellery brand became an FIG Official Jewellery Partner until the end of the year. The Mikelart brand was founded in 2002 by Michele Sessa, a goldsmith designer who developed a line of jewellery inspired by classical ballet. In 2014, in collaboration with the Italian Gymnastics Federation, the company added a jewellery line dedicated to gymnastics, and named ‘The Jewels of Gymnastics’.  48  FIG YEARBOOK 2024"

Over 500 attendees including delegates from over 150 out of a total of 159 affiliated member federations were present. Morinari Watanabe (JPN) was re-elected FIG President for a four-year term (2025-2028) at the Congress. Mr Watanabe, who has been in the post since 2016, received 102 votes (65.4% of the vote), while his challenger, Farid Gayibov (AZE), received 54 votes (34.6%). Following his re-election, he said: “Now is the time for gymnastics to take a big step forward. We are one gymnastics family. We respect each other. Let’s work together to create a bright future.” The Congress approved the 2022 and 2023 accounts and financial reports as  54  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  well as the report from the elected auditors and the external auditor. The financial plan for the 2025-2028 quadrennial was also presented and approved by the Congress.  New member federations Delegates approved the membership of five new affiliated national gymnastics federations, bringing the total number of affiliated federations to 164. While the gymnastics federation of Antigua and Barbuda (ANT), a country that counts a population of less than 100,000, has been granted full affiliation after being an associate member, the remaining four new members all come from Africa and represent a total population of over 100 million with a huge potential for developing gymnastics in the region.

T  he FIG’s efforts to meet the highest standards of governance gained further recognition in 2024. The fifth report by the Governance Task Force of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) was published in June and the FIG’s score, based on a like-for-like comparison with previous reports, increased to 163 out of a theoretical maximum of 200 points. That placed the FIG in the A2 group of ASOIF members. The five principles that are fundamental in this assessment are: transparency, integrity, democracy, development and sustainability, and control mechanisms. The FIG was ranked among the top 10 international federations for 10 of the 40 indicators taken into account in the report and scored well on several  58  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  of the new indicators introduced for the 2023 report, such as terms of reference for committees and information on decision-making authority at different levels.

Through this annual exercise, the FIG has sought to gain a deeper  understanding of the NFs by collecting information on the number of coaches, judges, and athletes within each federation, as well as their administrative capacity and preferred channels of communication.

W  hen the FIG New and Developing Countries Support Commission met in 2024, it set three clear goals for the next cycle: encouraging more FIG memberships, digitalising the affiliation menu to simplify the affiliation process and working towards finding solutions for the challenges that new and developing national federations (NFs) are facing. “All that we have already achieved is highly motivating for what is yet to come, so I am confident that we will make considerable progress in these three main projects,” said Juan Medina (COL), the commission President, at its April meeting at the FIG office in Lausanne. For new and developing nations, the opportunity to host an FIG Executive Committee (EC) meeting has been a  62  FIG YEARBOOK 2024  positive step, according to Medina. Once a year, a developing NF takes on hosting duties and a noteworthy example was Kampala’s (UGA) hosting of the EC meeting in February, which generated plenty of interest from the media along with the general public in the country. “These meetings are a great opportunity for the FIG to better understand the reality of such national federations, but they also allow for the federations to promote gymnastics in their country,” added Medina. To improve this process further, the commission set about working on specific guidelines for future meetings to help any interested NFs to better understand the eligibility criteria and define what activities should be organised around the meeting.

T  he inclusion of Paragymnastics as a new competitive discipline in the FIG Statutes, initially in Artistic Gymnastics, was officially approved at the 85th FIG Congress in Doha (QAT) in October. At the time, 42 national federations (NFs) were interested in developing Paragymnastics competitions. Subsequently, in December, the FIG Paragymnastics Working Group met at St Mary’s University in London (GBR) to plan the next steps. The main points on the agenda were clear: setting priorities and defining the way forward. In her opening speech, Nellie Kim, the President of the Working Group, said: “This is an historic moment for gymnastics, and we are very much looking forward to beginning our work.” The Working Group discussed administrative measures that needed to be taken, such as the composition of  a future Paragymnastics Commission, the potential competition calendar and the development of the discipline logo. On the technical side, it prepared the first drafts of the Men’s and Women’s Artistic Gymnastics Code of Points. “We also made significant progress in our Classification Code,” added Kim. “This is a crucial part of Paragymnastics, which requires thorough work and commitment to ensure that we are moving in the right direction.” To this end, the Working Group began working with medical specialists and is carefully following the International Paralympic Committee guidelines. It also agreed to submit a proposal to the Executive Committee to organise a Paragymnastics webinar in 2025 with the aim of updating NFs on the latest projects and developments.

F  or the FIG’s team of educators, 2024 was a productive year which saw a significant rise in academies – with 32 in total, compared with 25 a year earlier. Nineteen countries hosted at least one academy and along with the academies there were also Age Group camps and Olympic Solidarity courses, bringing important development opportunities to countries where gymnastics has previously had only a faint foothold. For example, the FIG Foundations of Gymnastics course in Fiji in May represented a significant step towards the development of gymnastics through the Oceania Union federations, featuring participants from Australia, Cook Islands, Tonga, American Samoa, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. The same could be said of the first-ever Parkour camps in Cameroon, Madagascar and Nicaragua, or the Age Group Training Camp for Aerobic Gymnastics in Burkina Faso in December.  68  FIG YEARBOOK 2024"

Educational content updated For the FIG’s Acrobatic and Aerobic Gymnastics working groups their respective tasks of reviewing and updating the content of their manuals for the Age Group Programme (AGP) and the FIG Academy were completed in 2024. This work ensured the manuals are now aligned with the latest developments in the disciplines and incorporate the new Code of Points. For the Aerobic Gymnastics working group, a priority was to make sure the revised manuals catered to gymnasts of all skill levels and ages, from beginners to elite performers, thus fostering inclusivity and accessibility. Similarly, the Parkour working group completed their review and updating of the Level 1 curriculum for the FIG Academy and Age Group Programme, responding to recent changes to the Code of Points and to the ongoing evolution of the discipline.

A  wait of eight years will come to an end when the World Gym for Life Challenge kicks off in Lisbon (POR) in 2025, adding to the excitement already surrounding an event set to welcome more than 3,000 gymnasts to the Portuguese capital between 22–26 July. That figure represents an increase of more than 50% on the number at the previous edition, while registered participants represent nearly 30 countries – up from 22. The 5,000-capacity MEO Arena will stage the contests and the closing ceremony, while the streets of Lisbon will play their part, too. Open-air performances on two stages in the city centre will follow the opening ceremony, which begins with a parade and concludes at the Praça do Comércio, an historic square on the banks of the River Tagus.  How it works The World Gym for Life Challenge is open to groups of gymnasts of all ages and abilities. Performances have a limit of five minutes, may incorporate any gymnastic element – with or without apparatus – and may be accompanied by music. Four experts will evaluate the choreographies according to their entertainment value, creativity, originality and technical quality. Each group is awarded either a gold, silver or bronze award, with the gold groups invited to perform at the World Gym for Life Gala, held on the final day of the contest. It’s the first of two major Gymnastics for All events Lisbon will host in the space of two years, with the World Gymnaestrada to follow in 2027.
